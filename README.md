"The Eco-Friendly Carpool Reservation System" is an innovative web application designed to promote eco-friendly carpooling. This system caters to both drivers who wish to share their journeys with other passengers to reduce their carbon footprint and passengers seeking eco-conscious shared rides. The application not only encourages sustainable mobility but also environmentally responsible driving.

System Actors:
Driver: Drivers are users who offer rides from their current location to a specified destination. They provide trip details such as departure time, the number of available seats, cost per passenger, and other relevant information. Drivers can manage reservations and accept or decline passengers.

Passenger: Passengers are users in search of rides. They can search for trips based on their starting point, destination, eco-preferences, and budget. Passengers can reserve seats in drivers' vehicles and manage their reservations.

Administrator: The administrator is responsible for user account management, content monitoring, issue resolution, and policy violation handling. The administrator ensures the platform's smooth operation and maintains a safe and reliable environment.

System Features:

Trip Posting: Drivers can post trips by providing details like the route, departure time, available seat count, cost per passenger, and eco-related vehicle information such as fuel consumption or vehicle type.

Trip Search: Passengers can search for trips by specifying their departure point, destination, eco-preferences (e.g., favoring electric vehicles), and budget. Search results display matching trips.

Seat Reservations: Passengers can reserve seats in drivers' vehicles. The system manages the reservation process and offers an integrated payment system to facilitate transactions.

Review and Rating Management: Passengers have the option to rate and comment on drivers based on their carpooling experience. Ratings and reviews contribute to building a trusted environment for users.

Account Management: Users can manage their profiles, add personal information, profile pictures, review past reservations, and make account changes.
